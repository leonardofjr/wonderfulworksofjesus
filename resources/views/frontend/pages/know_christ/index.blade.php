        <h2 class="text-center">Christ of Christianity</h2>
        <p>It may sound obvious, yet many people fail to recognise that the true key to understanding Christianity is contained in the very word itself, CHRIST-ianity. The key to understanding Christianity is understanding Christ.</p>
        <p>Christians aren’t just moral, well-behaved, religious people – they are people who believe that Jesus is the Christ! The term Christ was used to describe the one whom God would send into the world as the ultimate Saviour; the one who would take what was wrong in God’s creation and make it right again. He was the one spoken of by the Old Testament prophets. He was the deliverer, the Messiah.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of Christ on earth, it was as if God himself punched a hole in the ceiling of the world and climbed into our humanity, revealing Himself to us. It was like He put on an ‘earth suit’ and stooped down into the straw of Bethlehem’s manger. God was effectively putting skin on, clothing himself in humanity to become the lowest, and in doing so became ‘Immanuel’ (God with us.) What is important to understand however, is that by becoming human, by donning flesh and entering the world as you and I did, God was not emptying Himself of being who He was, and is, and always will be.</p>
        <p>Throughout scripture we see that Jesus made claims about Himself to prove that He was the Messiah:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus claimed to be God. (John 10:30-33 NIV)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to fulfill the scriptures. (John 5:39 NLT)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to have come from heaven. (John 3:13 NLT)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to be sinless. (1 Peter 1:18-19 NLT)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to be able to forgive sin. (Mark 2:5-7 NLT) 6.&nbsp;Jesus claimed to be the only way to heaven. (John 14:6 NLT)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to be able to give eternal life. (John 6:40 NIV)</li>
            <li>Jesus claimed to be the Christ. (Mark 14:61-62 NIV)</li>
        </ol>
